A continuation of work by Shweta Philip and Alex Pang of UCSC:
	https://github.com/AryaPhilip/RipCurrentDetectionAndVisualization

Requirements: a C++ compiler, opencv 3.4.1 (not tested with other versions), CMake (unlessyou want to figure out how to link opencv libraries yourself).

Compilation instructions: For the main branch, in RipCurrents_main
$cmake .
$make



RipCurrents_main is the main version
RipCurrents_android is the android fork (tends to be very slow and not fully featured).
